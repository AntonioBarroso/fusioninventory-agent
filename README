		FusionInventory agent network tasks
		-----------------------------------

Description 
-----------
This plugin provides two additional tasks for FusionInventory:
- NetDiscovery allows to scan the network to find and identify connected devices
- NetInventory allows to extract various informations from connected devices

They are distributed together as closely related. The typical workflow is to
first discover devices, once, to import them in the inventory with minimal
information, and then to extract information from them as often as needed to
populate the inventory.

NetDiscovery use the following tools, if available, to scan IP networks:
nmap external command, Net::NBName and Net::SNMP perl modules. Devices found
will be reported as unkwown device with few additional informations, such as
mac address and hostname, unless identified as a specific device. Currently, 
identification works  only through SNMP, tough, and relies on exact matching of
the device sysdescr field in a the SNMP models dictionnary from the GLPI
server. As this sysdescr field content is highly dependant of exact
hardware/firmware combination, a device will be either perfectly identified, if
already known, or not indentified at all.

NetInventory can be applied to any device discovered AND identified in the
previous step, as it relies on the usage of an SNMP model to describe the
device, and map specific features with known SNMP variables identifiers. Once
again, there is no partial descriptive model available: if the device is known,
it can be inventoried completly, if it is not, it can't be.

Dependencies
------------
This task requires a FusionInventory agent (minimal version 2.2.0), and can
only be executed with a GLPI server with FusionInventory plugin.

Additional perl modules:
- Net::SNMP (mandatory for inventory, optional for discovery)
- Net::NBName (optional for discovery)

Additional programs:
- nmap (optional for discovery)

		FusionInventory agent NetDiscovery task
		---------------------------------------

Description 
-----------
This tasks scans the network to find connected devices, allowing:
- devices discovery within an IP range, through nmap, NetBios or SNMP
- devices identification, through SNMP

NetDiscovery use the following tools, if available, to scan IP networks:
nmap external command, Net::NBName and Net::SNMP perl modules. Devices found
will be reported as unkwown device with few additional informations, such as
mac address and hostname, unless identified as a specific device. Currently, 
identification works  only through SNMP, tough, and relies on exact matching of
the device sysdescr field in a the SNMP models dictionnary from the GLPI
server. As this sysdescr field content is highly dependant of exact
hardware/firmware combination, a device will be either perfectly identified, if
already known, or not indentified at all.

Once discovered, devices can be imported in the inventory and then inventoried
with NetInventory task.

only be executed with a GLPI server with FusionInventory plugin.

		FusionInventory agent network tasks
		-----------------------------------

Description 
-----------
This plugin for the agent provides two tasks that were previously distributed
separatly:

- the NetDiscovery task allows the agent to scan the network to find remote
  devices, through nmap, NetBios or SNMP, and to identify them
- the NetInventory task allows the agent to extract various informations from
  a remote device through SNMP protocol

Dependencies
------------
This plugin requires a FusionInventory agent (minimal version 2.2.0), and is
intended to be used with a GLPI server with FusionInventory plugin.

Additional mandatory perl modules:
- Net::SNMP

Additional optional perl modules:
- Net::NBName

Additional optional programs:
- nmap

Usage
-----
The NetDiscovery task uses the following methods to scan IP networks:
- ICMP scan, using nmap external command
- NetBIOS scan, using Net::NBName perl module
- SNMP scan, using Net::SNMP perl module
Any device replying to one of those protocols will be discovered, with just
minimal information, such as mac address and hostname.

If the device replies to SNMP, an additional identification attempt is
performed, using the device system description (SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0) field.
First, this value is compared to a database of known values (the SNMP
description models dictionnary). If there is an exact match, the device
category (printer, network device, etc...) can be identified, and a SNMP
description model assigned, to use with NetInventory later. If there is no such
value in the database, various heuristics are used to guess the device category
and vendor from the sysdescr field.

Discovered devices are then reported to the GLPI servers, where they will be 
available for inventory import (import rules can be used to automatize this
step). Warning, GLPI will consider every device as 'unknown', unless an SNMP
description model has been assigned. This implies than only devices whose exact
combination of harware/firmware is present in the SNMP description models
dictionnary will be completly identified upon discovery step.

The NetInventory task can be applied to any device already present in the
inventory, provided it is assigned an SNMP description model. This model maps
device features (ports list, for instance) with SNMP variables identifiers
specific to a given combination of hardware and firmware. This is typically
achieved through usage of NetDiscovery task, which automatically identifies
known devices, and assign them the correct model. As device discovery uses the
same database than device inventory, a failure to assign a model during the
discovery phase means there isn't any relevant model for this device.

Command-line usage
------------------
Two command-line tools are provided for testing purposes:
- fusioninventory-netdiscovery
- fusioninventory-netinventory

While allowing to perform the corresponding task without a running server, they
still requires some data files shipped in the server sources (SNMP dictionnary
and SNMP description models).

		FusionInventory agent network tasks
		-----------------------------------

Description 
-----------
This plugin for FusionInventory agent provides two additional tasks, for
handling remote devices:

- the NetDiscovery task allows the agent to scan the network to find remote
  devices, through nmap, NetBios or SNMP, and to identify them
- the NetInventory task allows the agent to extract various informations from
  a remote device through SNMP protocol

The NetDiscovery task use the following tools, if available, to scan IP networks:
- nmap external command
- Net::NBName perl module
- Net::SNMP perl module
This allows to discover remote devices, with a few additional information,
such as mac address and hostname, but not to identify them.

If the device replies to SNMP, an additional identification attempt is
performed, by comparing its sysdescr field with a database of known values. If 
there is an exact match, an SNMP description model can be assigned, allowing to
immediatly identify the device category (printer, network device, etc...), and
to use NetInventory task later to fetch additional informations.

Wether identified or not, discovered devices are reported to GLPI as 'unknown
device', and have to be imported in the inventory.

The NetInventory task can be applied to any device already present in the
inventory, provided it is assigned an SNMP description model. This model maps
device features (ports list, for instance) with SNMP variables identifiers
specific to a given combination of hardware and firmware. This is typically
achieved through usage of NetDiscovery task, which automatically identifies
known devices, and assign them the correct model. As device discovery uses the
same database than device inventory, a failure to assign a model during the
discovery phase means there isn't any relevant model for this device.

Dependencies
------------
This plugin requires a FusionInventory agent (minimal version 2.2.0), and is
intended to be used with a GLPI server with FusionInventory plugin. Some
standalone command-line tools allow to run NetDiscovery and NetInventory tasks
without a running server, but they still requires some data files shipped in
the server sources (SNMP dictionnary and SNMP description models).

Additional mandatory perl modules:
- Net::SNMP

Additional optional perl modules:
- Net::NBName

Additional optional programs:
- nmap

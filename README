		FusionInventory agent NetInventory task
		---------------------------------------

Description
-----------
This task allows the agent to extracts various informations from remote hosts
through SNMP protocol:
- printer cartridges and counters status
- router/switch ports status
- relations between devices and router/switch ports

NetInventory can be applied to any device already present in the inventory,
provided it is assigned an SNMP description model. This model maps device
features (ports list, for instance) with SNMP variables identifiers specific
to a given combination of hardware and firmware. This is typically achieved
through usage of NetDiscovery task, which automatically identifies known
devices, and assign them the correct model. As device identification uses
the same description model than device inventory, failure to identify also
means there isn't any relevant model for this device.

Dependencies
------------
This task requires a FusionInventory agent (minimal version 2.2.0), and can
only be executed with a GLPI server with FusionInventory plugin.

Additional mandatory perl modules:
- Net::SNMP

		FusionInventory agent network tasks
		-----------------------------------

Description 
-----------
This plugin provides two additional tasks for FusionInventory:
- NetDiscovery allows to scan the network to find and identify connected devices
- NetInventory allows to extract various informations from connected devices

They are distributed together as closely related. The typical workflow is to
first discover devices, once, so as to import them in the inventory with
minimal information, and then to extract information from them as often as
needed to populate the inventory.

Dependencies
------------
This task requires a FusionInventory agent (minimal version 2.2.0), and can
only be executed with a GLPI server with FusionInventory plugin.

Additional perl modules:
- Net::SNMP (mandatory for inventory, optional for discovery)
- Net::NBName (optional for discovery)

Additional programs:
- nmap (optional for discovery)
